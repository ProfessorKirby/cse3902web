    <h2>Sprints</h2>
    Sprints are the deliverables for this course.  In the computer games industry, these correspond to milestones and successful
    completion of a milestone
    allows your game studio to get paid by their publisher.  There are multiple parts to the later sprints (2-5).
    The implementations emphasize what you delivered - the product.  Sprints 3-5 carry an additional part - response to feedback
    on the prior sprint.  This part emphasizes process - how your team integrated feedback from the prior sprint.  The response to
    feedback is also graded and affects
    your grade.
