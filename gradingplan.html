<ul>
  <li>Sprints - 60%</li>
  <ul>
	<li>Sprint 0 - 12%</li>
    <li>Sprint 1 - 0%</li>
    <li>Sprint 2 - 12%</li>
    <li>Sprint 3 - 12%</li>
    <li>Sprint 4 - 12%</li>
    <li>Sprint 5 - 12%</li>
   </ul>
  <li>Quizzes - 20%</li>
  <li>Final Exam - 20%</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: the sprint team scores you receive represent an estimate for you to calculate your final grade,
but they will be modified based on your level of contribution to your team's project as determined at the end
of the semester. This is determined by team peer evaluations, 
code commit logs (mostly the number and frequency of commits), and
observations by the instructor on the student's performance on the project and in the course 
(mostly class attendance and participation).

<p>
The revised grading method for sprints allows us to use the standard OSU grading scale.  The net result is that teams that follow the rules and do the work can expect excellent grades.
