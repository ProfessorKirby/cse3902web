    <h2><i>"The Ferraris are just gravy"</i> - John Carmack of id Software</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This is a Junior-level course on professional software development.
        Our goals are to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                craft high-quality software
            </li>
            <li>
                understand the process of Agile software development
            </li>
            <li>
                survey design patterns
            </li>
            <li>
                become familiar with advanced tools for software development and project management
            </li>
            <li>
                gain experience working in a small sized team (5-6 people)
            </li>
            <li>
                be able to read what your code actuallys says instead of what you want it to mean
            </li>
            <li>
                gain experince with project management
            </li>
        </ul>
        To facilitate reaching these goals, you will
        work on developing and refining an engine for 2D games over the course of the semester.
        There will be a large amount of critiquing of code and interactive feedback.
        This will lead to refinement and improvement of your software (for future expansion and maintenance).
