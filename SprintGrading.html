    <h3>General notes on Sprint grading</h3>
    <p>
        Point allocation for grading of Sprints 2-5 come from three areas: planning/documentation, correctness, and
        code quality/refactoring. Teams will receive a numeric score out of 40 on each sprint.
        <a href="SprintGradingRubric.htm">Here is the current rubric</a>
        Individual grades for the project portion may be raised or lowered based on team evaluations and individual contributions
        to the project as assessed at the end of the semester.
        Mid-semester, in the case of an individual student not contributing
        (or only trivially so, ex: tracking only 1 task or committing code for only 1 method body)
        on one or more of the three graded areas of the sprint,
        the instructor reserves the right to change that portion of the individual student's score for that sprint to a 0.
    </p>

    <h3>Planning & Project Management</h3>
    A portion of points for each sprint is dedicated to planning and project management.
    Carefully read the sprint specifications and grading rubrics to come up with tasks needed for the sprint,
    estimate the hours needed to complete each task, and update time remaining on tasks as work is done over the course of the sprint.
    The accuracy of your time estimates will not affect your score, only your participation and honest effort in tracking time spent
    working and using the resulting data to evaluate your team's workflow.<br /><br />
    Be sure to look at the git-related item.


    <h3>Correctness</h3>
    A portion of points for each sprint is dedicated to the correctness of the deliverable.
    To ensure enough time is devoted to code quality and refactoring, a fully functional implementation must be completed by a little over halfway through each sprint.
    Partial credit will be given for partially working features; Mario/block collision detection and response is used as an example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The feature is fully functional, but not necessarily in the exact same way as it was in the original game - 100% [ex: Mario doesn't get stuck in blocks but hovers 1 pixel off of the ground]
        </li>
        <li>
            The feature is partially functional, with a few erroneous use cases - 50% [ex: Only when running or falling at high speed, Mario can pass through a block or get stuck in it]
        </li>
        <li>
            No implementation or many erroneous use cases - 0% [ex: Mario gets stuck in blocks at any speed]
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code Quality</h3>
    A portion of points for each sprint is dedicated to code quality. You start with full credit and lose points for flaws in code quality.
    Here are some problems/code smells that we will be looking for when grading code quality.
    Occasionally violating one of these does not mean a design is bad, but this is what you should strive for.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Long methods (25+ lines)
        </li>
        <li>
            Excessive Branching (3+ levels deep in one method)
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Long classes (100+ lines)
        </li>
        <li>
            Low cohesion of a class or method
        </li>
        <li>
            High coupling (many dependencies) in a class
        </li>
        <li>
            Tight coupling (too much knowledge/use of another class' fields/data) in a method
        </li>
        <li>
            Non-descriptive class, field, and method names
        </li>
        <li>
            Public fields, properties, and methods that should be private
        </li>
        <li>
            Dead code and unused fields and methods
            <br /><br />
        </li>
        <li>
            Duplicated code
        </li>
        <li>
            Magic numbers and strings
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Customer Interaction</h3>
    Your team should seek feedback along the way.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your team is expected to meet with the graders during the sprint.
            This should be done while there is still plenty of time to incorporate changes.
            It should not be so early that the team has little to talk about.  In some cases a follow-up
            meeting is called for.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your team should also ask for an in-class code review in a timely fashion.
            The points are awarded for asking in a timely fashion - the quality of the code will not change the points.
            The request should include the team name, course section, the team git URL, the branch(es) to review, and
            any areas that the team wants looked at.
        </li>
    </ul>
<br />


    <hr />
    <br />
    <p>
        In case you're wondering - why these values instead of something else? -
        the short answer is that these tend to result in code that you'll be able to tolerate for the whole semester.
