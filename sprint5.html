    <h1>Sprint 5 - extending your game framework</h1>
    <p><strong>Due dates:</strong> </p>(See main webpage for calendar dates)
    <ul>
        <li>
            Initial planning: Tuesday midnight
        </li>
        <li>
            Due date: on a Saturday at noon
        </li>
        <li>
            Peer evaluation rubric (spreadsheet file on Carmen): due the Monday after
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> Extend your implementation in some interesting way.
        You may choose topics from the list below or come up with your own.
        Early on in the sprint, your team <b>must</b> contact the instructor with your proposed topics 
        for feedback on if the workload is sufficient.
        It does not necessarily need to be a coordinated plan, everyone can work on their own 
        completely different pieces, but it should still be all part of one application when finished

                            Were any changes your made this sprint constructive or detrimental?
                            Do you have any plans for doing things differently next sprint?

    <p><strong>On code reviews</strong>:</p>
    <p>
        The best way to fulill the requirement of documenting reviewing of code within your team is by doing <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">pull requests</a>.
        Alternatively, you can write up code reviews in plaintext documents to be submitted with the project.
        In the root folder of the project, add a folder to store code reviews.
        You can add plaintext files to the project in this folder by going to the Project menu, add new item, and select text file under the general option.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the plaintext file for a readability review, include the following information:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Author of the code review
            </li>
            <li>
                Date of the code review
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprint number
            </li>
            <li>
                Name of the .cs file being reviewed
            </li>
            <li>
                Author of the .cs file being reviewed
            </li>
            <li>
                Number of minutes taken to complete the review
            </li>
            <li>

    <h3>Project Submission</h3>
    <p>
        One member of your team should follow the build->clean and project folder zipping process from Sprint0 and turn in your project on Carmen on the appropriate assignment page.
        If they aren't included in the zip file, also add your README and sprint reflection documents (and any other project management documents you made).
        After the sprint is over, everyone should fill out a peer review form rating the work of everyone on your team, yourself included, for that sprint and turn in the file on Carmen on the assignment page for the peer review.
        Additionally, at least one member of your team will need to arrange a meeting with your grader to review your work (at minimum the contents of your board, but you may review more).
    </p>
    <p>
        The peer reviews are one of the main ways we get information about how your team is doing, so take your time to fill them out thoroughly and honestly.
        In cases where peer reviews provide conflicting information,
        either in inconsistent scores for a team member or inconsistency in scores and the overall functionality of the project,
        your team might be asked to meet with the instructor to review your code commit logs to obtain more detailed information on each team member's contribution.

    <h3>Grading</h3>
    <p>
        Each sprint you'll receive feedback on how your team is progressing. Your grader will review your work and provide comments on
        <ul>
            <li>
                your documentation (task tracking, code reviews, code metrics/analysis)
            </li>
            <li>
                code functionality (has your team implemented enough work for its size and how buggy is it)
            </li>
            <li>
                (workload permitting also comments on code quality)
            </li>
        </ul>
        See <a href="SprintGradingRubric.htm">Sprint Grading Rubric</a>

        Your instructor will review your work (frequency TBD, likely to be every other sprint rather than all of them but the intial plan to is try to do so for all of the sprints) and provide comments on
        <ul>
            <li>
                code quality
            </li>
        </ul>
        Code quality will also play a role in determining numeric project scores at the end of the semester.
        Note that 40% of the project scores are based on meeting high quality code standards.
        You should refactor your code to eliminate any major code quality problems cited by your instructor and grader.
        Minor issues may be excused but only after discussing the details with your instructor.
